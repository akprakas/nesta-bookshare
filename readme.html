<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>In Terminal, move to the folder you want to contain your Bookshare application.</p>

<p>We're going to set up Bookshare for the fictional town of Casterbridge.</p>

<hr />

<p>Fork the main project repository into your own account by clicking the <strong>Fork</strong> button on the <a href="https://github.com/adrianshort/nesta-bookshare">main project page</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Clone your new git repository to your local machine:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/your-username/nesta-bookshare.git casterbridgebookshare
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Move into your Bookshare folder:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd casterbridgebookshare
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Make a copy of the default theme to use for your own site.</p>

<p><strong>Do not edit the default theme itself as it'll get overwritten when you next pull down a copy of the latest Bookshare version.</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ cp -r themes/default/ themes/casterbridge/
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Make a copy of the sample configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>$ cp config/config-sample.yml config/config.yml
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Open <code>config/config.yml</code> in your text editor and fill in your details. You can change these at any time in future.</p>

<p>It might look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>sitename: Casterbridge Bookshare
theme: casterbridge
email: mike.henchard@casterbridge.gov.uk
noreply_email: noreply@casterbridge.gov.uk
twitter: casterbridgebookshare
google_analytics: UA-XXXXX-X
</code></pre>

<p><em>sitename</em> is the human-readable name of your site</p>

<p><em>theme</em> is the name of your theme's folder within <code>/themes</code></p>

<p><em>email</em> is your main public contact email address</p>

<p><em>noreply_email</em> is used as the sender address on some outbound email messages. Use a noreply address at your domain if you've got one or your main contact address if you're happy to receive replies to these.</p>

<p><em>twitter</em> is the name of the Twitter account for your Bookshare project. Don't include the @ sign at the beginning.  Leave this out if you don't have a Twitter account for your Bookshare.</p>

<p><em>google_analytics</em> is the web property ID (starts with "UA") for your site on <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>. If you're not using Analytics to track your web statistics just leave this blank.</p>

<hr />

<p>Add and commit the <code>config.yml</code> file to your local git repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git add config/config.yml
$ git commit config/config.yml -m "Added my details"
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Put your database details in <code>config/database.yml</code></p>

<hr />

<p>Build the database:</p>

<pre><code>$ rake db:migrate
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Now you're good to go.</p>
